# dataNodes
classes for the nodes datatype

###Overview
A polymorphic approach to data nodes involves a parent or abstract node class with derivative or specialization classes for the different data-type to be worked with in data scientific applications.

This specializations are:

  -  string type nodes
  -  integer type nodes
  -  double type nodes and category or factor type nodes, this latter is intern a specialization of the integer type to account for the levels and the level names in the categories
  
## Design notes
see the design notes directory here which contains the UML and commentary of the development planning for nodes.
