#Design Notes for the Data Nodes Classes

see the UML diagrams accompanying here

 The classes in development are:

   -  node, the abstract base class
   
   -  nodeInt, a derivative specialization of node for integer type data
   
   -  nodeStr, a derivative specialization of node for string type data
   
   -  nodeDbl, a derivative specialization of node for double type data
   
   -  nodeCat, a node of categorical data derived from the integer type data node
